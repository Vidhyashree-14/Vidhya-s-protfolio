# [Project name: Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard](https://vidhyashree-14.github.io/Vidhya-s-protfolio/)

## This project I did as part of my learning, where I build Coffee shop sales dashboard.
* Data was taken from Maven Analytics.
* Tool Used is Microsoft Excel.
### The objectives are to create a data profile and prepare the raw data for analysis. Columns are added to create a revenue field based on the price and quantity, and extract information such as the month, day of the week, and hour of the day from our transaction date and transaction time columns. 
* Explore the data with pivot tables.
* In the filter- Location of store is given.
* To form pivot tables of:
1. Revenue by Month
2. Transactions by Day of Week
3. Transactions by hours
4. Transactions by Product category
* Create an interactive Dashboard to visualize patterns and trends.
